A personal journey of tackling coding challenges from **NeetCode** and honing problem-solving skills in Python.

---

##  Repository Overview

This repository is a hub for all coding problems solved using NeetCode’s curated list.  
Each problem resides in its own module or directory, grouped by topic (e.g., `arrays`).

---

##  Directory Structure

neetcode/
└── arrays/
├── solution1.py
├── solution2.py
└── ...

- **arrays/**: Python solutions for array-based problems (LeetCode, NeetCode lists, etc.)

*(Add other directories as you expand into strings, dynamic programming, graphs, etc.)*

---

##  Motivation & Objectives

My aim with this repository is to:
- Practice structured problem-solving with clear, readable Python code.
- Build a resource for reference and future interview prep.
- Track progress and growth over time.

---

##  How to Use

1. **Clone this repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shraddhagreddy/neetcode.git
2. Explore by topic
   Navigate into folders (e.g., arrays/) to review solutions.

3. Run problems
   Simply run in your terminal:
   python arrays/solution1.py

4. Contribute
   Add new topic folders or problems as you tackle them.
   Include a brief description of your approach, time & space complexity, and any optimizations or edge cases.
